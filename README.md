> \- Me

Hexatris is an over-engineered variation of Tetris made in Scratch3

To play the game, install a Scratch3 editor ike Turbowarp and open the sb3 file in the editor, then press "R" and start playing

This project is still in development, many features aren't finalized and still unoptimized, so keep that in mind while using this project I guess
